Howdy there, Colin McDonald speaking. I'm starting a CS PhD at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2023, and my broad research interests include programming languages, type theory, quantum computing, NLP, and formal logic. I'm particularly fascinated by dependent type systems, linear type systems, and characterizing effects in functional programming languages.
