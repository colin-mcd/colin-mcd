Howdy there, Colin McDonald speaking. I'm a first-year CS PhD at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Umut Acar](https://www.umut-acar.org/), and my broad research interests include programming languages, type theory, quantum computing, NLP, and formal logic. I'm particularly fascinated by quantum circuit compilation, linear type systems, and characterizing effects in functional programming languages.
